        "generated": "Start by considering what we know about thunderstorms. They often come with lightning, which poses a serious risk. Lightning tends to strike the tallest object available, which can sometimes be a person if they're in the right (or wrong) place. Other hazards might include heavy rain, strong winds, hail, and even occasional tornadoes. So, it is generally safer to stay indoors where you're protected from these elements.\n\nSo, the answer to the question: No, it is generally not safe to go outside during a thunderstorm due to the risks of lightning, heavy rain, strong winds, hail, and potential for other severe weather conditions."
