        Accomplish the task below by decomposing it as many very explicit subtasks as possible, be very explicit and thorough denoted by 
        a search process, highlighted by markers ‘1’,..., ‘3’ as “first operations” guiding subtree exploration for the OBJECTIVE, 
        focus on the third subtree exploration. Produce prospective search steps (e.g., the subtree exploration ‘5. 11 + 1’) 
        and evaluates potential subsequent steps to either progress
        towards a solution or retrace to another viable subtree then be very thorough 
        and think atomically then provide solutions for those subtasks, 
        then return the definitive end result and then summarize it

Prompt :  To achieve the following goal: '
Is it safe to go outside during a thunderstorm?
', pessimistically value the context of the past solutions and more importantly the latest generated solution you had AS A FLOAT BETWEEN 0 AND 1

                    Past solutions:


                    1. Define the main problem: Understanding the safety of going outside during a thunderstorm.

2. Break down the main problem into subtasks:
    1.1. Understand what a thunderstorm is.
    1.2. Research the dangers associated with thunderstorms.
    1.3. Understand what activities are typically done outside during a thunderstorm.
    1.4. Evaluate the risk associated with each of these activities.
    1.5. Determine under what circumstances, if any, it might be safe to go outside during a thunderstorm.

3. Begin the third subtask exploration: Understand what activities are typically done outside during a thunderstorm.
    3.1. List out common outdoor activities such as walking, jogging, playing outdoor sports, gardening, etc.
    3.2. Consider unusual or less common outdoor activities such as flying a kite, swimming, etc.
    3.3. Include activities that may be necessary such as emergency repairs, rescue operations, etc.

4. Evaluate the risk associated with each of these activities during a thunderstorm.
    4.1. Research the likelihood of lightning striking people during different activities.
    4.2. Consider the risk of injury from other elements of a thunderstorm, such as strong winds, heavy rain, or hail.
    4.3. Take into account the availability and effectiveness of safety measures for each activity.
    4.4. Rank the activities based on their relative risk.

5. Determine under what circumstances, if any, it might be safe to go outside during a thunderstorm.
    5.1. Consider the severity of the thunderstorm.
    5.2. Take into account the necessity of the outdoor activity.
    5.3. Evaluate the availability of safe shelter nearby.
    5.4. Consider the individual's physical condition and ability to react to sudden changes.

6. Compile the results of the subtasks
       
                    If the solutions is not making fast progress in achieving the goal, give it a lower score.
                    Evaluate all solutions AS A FLOAT BETWEEN 0 and 1:

                    Past solutions:


                    1. Begin by understanding the objective: Is it safe to go outside during a thunderstorm?
2. Decompose the objective into subtasks:

    2.1 Understand what a thunderstorm is.
    
    2.2 Research on the dangers of thunderstorms.
    
    2.3 Investigate if it is safe to be outside during a thunderstorm.
    
    2.4 Identify the safety measures to take during a thunderstorm.

3. Focus on the third subtask: Investigate if it is safe to be outside during a thunderstorm. 

    3.1 Identify reliable sources of information to conduct the investigation.
    
    3.2 Search for credible articles, research papers, and reports on the safety of being outside during a thunderstorm.
    
    3.3 Analyze the information gathered to determine the safety level.
    
    3.4 Evaluate the potential risks and dangers of being outside during a thunderstorm.

4. Solutions for the subtasks:

    4.1 A thunderstorm is a storm characterized by the presence of lightning and its acoustic effect on the Earth's atmosphere, known as thunder.

    4.2 Dangers of thunderstorms can include lightning strikes, strong winds, hail, and flash flooding.
    
    4.3 Based on credible sources, it is generally not safe to be outside during a thunderstorm. The risk of being struck by lightning, even if small, is still present.
    
    4.4 Safety measures during a thunderstorm include seeking shelter in a safe building or vehicle, avoiding water, high ground, and open spaces, staying away from objects that conduct electricity, and waiting a significant amount of time after hearing the last thunder before going outside.

5. Definitive end result: Based on the information gathered and analyzed, it is not safe to go outside during a thunderstorm due to the potential risks and dangers such as lightning strikes, strong winds, hail, and flash
