# Promoting-Patterns-Project

This repository contains the code implementation and analysis of different prompting patterns to explore their impact on user trust. The code implementation is divided into several components, each focusing on a specific aspect of the study. The main goal is to understand how different prompting patterns influence user trust across various cognitive tasks.

## Components

### 1. Promoting Patterns Tasks
Scripts and tasks designed to evaluate the effectiveness of different prompting methods in real-world scenarios.

### 2. Pictures
Visual representations such as plots and charts that illustrate the findings from the analyses.

### 3. Analysis of Variance
Contains scripts and data for conducting ANOVA tests to assess statistically significant differences in user trust scores across different thought models.

### 4. Keyword Extraction
Includes scripts and processed datasets for extracting and analyzing keywords from user feedback, which help in understanding user trust dynamics.

### 5. Data
This directory contains all the data used and generated during the project. It includes the following:
- `questionnaire_feedback.xlsx`: This file includes feedback data collected from the complete questionnaire. It contains user responses that can be used to understand the perceptions and trust levels of users interacting with different AI prompting methods. Please refer to the file for detailed information on data structure and contents.
- `complete_data.xlsx`:  This file includes participants' completed status, participants' completed time and participants' feedback data collected from the complete questionnaire.

## Project Setup

Each directory contains a specific part of the project. Navigate to each folder to find detailed README.md files explaining the scripts, data, and usage instructions specific to that component.

## Installation
